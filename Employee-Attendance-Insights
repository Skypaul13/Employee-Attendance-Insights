Description :
In this project, we analyzed employee attendance to determine the percentage of people working from home and onsite, as well as the percentage of leaves, using interactive dashboards and visual charts.


âœ… 1. Overall Presence Rate
Average Presence %: 170.33% (likely cumulative or duplicated entries â€“ may need data validation)

Trend: Fairly consistent presence percentage across months (Aprâ€“Jun)

âœ… 2. Work From Home (WFH)
Average WFH %: 11.15%

Lowest in April; slightly increased in May and June.

âœ… 3. Sick Leave (SL)
Average Sick Leave %: 2.01%

Total Sick Leave Count: 48 leaves across all employees in 3 months

Trend is very low and steady â€” no significant spikes
